This was a GROUP PROJECT where we implemented a single Person Shooter survival game in C. I mainly focused on Gameplay so mouse/key handling, movement
of character sprites, and development of characters such as implementing xp, coins, creating a game store, and rendering stats. I also helped
out others with their development.
